# Society Sim!

Okay, so this is just a silly program that should simulate a community of people that interacts amongst themselves (mostly by marrying each other, getting divorced and having kids), while also aging, dying from age, diseases or accidents, etc.  

The idea came about when I was amidst a conversation about The Sims games. This is not meant as a copy or anything like it, but the thought of simulating a community kept my interest when I began to think about how to implement it and the things I could attempt with it.

This is a (non-exhaustive) list of things I plan on adding:  
- [ ] Improving random name generation (ideally, this would be another ongoing project of mine, but we'll see)
- [ ] Simulating encounters between people, which may or may not result in...
- [ ] Babies
    - [ ] Crossover and mutation! (I had a really bad time with AI classes, this is my comeback story)
- [ ] Families
    - [ ] Marriage and Divorce
- [ ] Health and Diseases
- [ ] Dying!
    - [ ] ... from old age
    - [ ] ... from accidents
    - [ ] ... from diseases
- [ ] Graphical representation (however that is; not sure what I'll attempt yet)
- [ ] Continuous simulation
    - [ ] Pausable simulation
